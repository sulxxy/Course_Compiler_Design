# ZCompiler
This project will build a simple but practical compiler(I call it **ZCompiler**).

All of the theory parts I have learned from the course `Compiler Design`(including lab units) are located in the branch [theory](https://github.com/sulxxy/ZCompiler/tree/theory) of this project.

Also, in branch [kaleidoscope](https://github.com/sulxxy/ZCompiler/tree/kaleidoscope), I'm following the instruction from the [llvm documentation](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/) to build a compiler for a toy language [kaleidoscope](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/LangImpl01.html#the-basic-language).
